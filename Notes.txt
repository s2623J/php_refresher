    ------
    Definitions:
        Class:          Blueprint for an object 
        Property:       Variable of an object 
        Method:         Function of an object 
        Instantiation:  Object creation from a class
        Encapsulation:  Bundling properties with methods
        Inheritance:    Reusing code from other classes via "extends"
        Polymorphism:   Changing an object without having to change the class via properties, or "extends"

    Classes:
        $this:          Can only be used within instantiated objects
        constructors:   Execute immediately on instantiation and set initial values
        Visibility:
            Private Variables - Only visible within the class 
            Public Variables - Visible inside and out of the class
            Protected Variables - Only visible within the class AND within any child 
                classes that extend that class
            Final Methods - Cannot be overridden by children (imutable)
        Inheritance:
            Classes that have been extended can have their properties and methods overridden.
